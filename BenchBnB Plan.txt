README

=== PLAN ===
- Set up project in VS, getting Unity and EF packages; also,
 set up Git repository and utlitize issues list / project kanban layout.
- Create Models with Properties and Methods.
- Establish landing page / login page / register page, with authorization.
- Get Entity Framework and the Database up and running.
- Implement "Add Bench"; no map for now, just a button to bring you to a form to fill out. 
- Implement scroll wheel and pagination on bench list.
- Implement the ability to view the page of a specific bench.
- Implement the ability to add reviews to a specific bench.
- Find how to implement the map api call and functionality onto the pages it belongs.
- Refactor adding a bench via map clicks.
- Fix BootStrap. Somehow.
